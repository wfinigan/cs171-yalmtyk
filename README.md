Overview of Story:
in November 2016, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot initiative that legalized the use of recreational marijuana in the state. The Boston Police Departmentâ€™s incident reports provide a compelling lens through which to examine the impact of this legalization on law enforcement policing and strategies. While law enforcement themselves purports to not have seen a change in their policing efforts since the decriminalization occured, the data tells a different story. Marijuana violations have gone down since legalization. Interestingly, breaking down Class D violations into intent to distribute and possession violations offers a way to reconcile this apparent discrepancy between what the data shows and what police say is happening. Police have not changed their behavior in policing intent to distribute in terms of numbers, but they have cut down possession violations almost in half.

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Since 1930, the FBI has compiled the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which reports official crime data from smaller law enforcement agencies. This data has traditionally been used by police departments and legislatures alike to allocate funds, target specific regions, and determine policing priorities. While data-based decision making is not new to policing, the form and extent of its role have changed with the technological data revolution. Big data has been touted as the “new weapon against crime.” Increasingly broader data sources, predictive algorithms and surveillance technologies have permitted police to visualize crime differently. Over sixty percent of police departments in the US use some variant of predictive policing algorithms; in Chicago, for example, a “heat list” compiled by an algorithm highlights individuals “at risk” of becoming either those who commit or are affected by gun violence, while in Los Angeles, patrols are determined by where an algorithm determines regions to be “crime hot-spots”. These algorithms are trained and developed using crime statistics, some of which are publicly available. Though some argue these practices have improved the efficiency and effectiveness of policing, others have criticized them due to the threats they pose to civil liberties and individuals’ rights. Critics are particularly vocal when these measures involve the use of black-box algorithms, so that the way they function is unknown and therefore particularly ripe for abuse. At the same time this revolution in policing practices is occuring, trust in police is at a low.
